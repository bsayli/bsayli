# 👋 Hi, I'm Barış Saylı

**Hands-on Software Architect / Backend Lead (Java 21, Spring Boot 3.x)**  
I help teams stabilize and evolve production backends: **service boundaries, API contracts, security**, and **maintainable refactoring** — without breaking production.

**Proof-driven work:** I publish runnable reference implementations that show problems, trade-offs, and deterministic outcomes.

---

## ✅ What I Deliver (in real teams)

- **Safe modernization & refactoring** of live systems (boundaries, modularization, DDD-friendly structure)
- **Contract-driven APIs** (server + client alignment, OpenAPI ownership, drift prevention)
- **Security & identity foundations** (Keycloak, OAuth2/JWT, service-to-service patterns)
- **Observability baselines** (OpenTelemetry, Sentry; tracing/logging foundations)

---

## 🔭 Focus Areas

- Architecture & delivery in production
- API contracts & client generation (OpenAPI, generics/envelopes)
- Security (Keycloak, OAuth2, JWT)
- Observability (OTel, Sentry)
- Platform-style shared components (reusable libraries)

## 📂 Featured Projects (proof over claims)

### [spring-boot-openapi-generics-clients](https://github.com/bsayli/spring-boot-openapi-generics-clients)
For **API platform / backend teams** generating clients and fighting **generic envelope drift + duplicated DTOs**.  
**Proof:** end-to-end runnable setup + before/after screenshots + shared canonical `api-contract` (`ServiceResponse<T>`, `ServiceResponse<Page<T>>`).

### [codegen-blueprint](https://github.com/blueprint-platform/codegen-blueprint)
For **architects / platform engineers** who want architecture that is **verified by the build** (not tribal knowledge).  
**Proof:** generated ArchUnit guardrails fail deterministically during `mvn verify` with screenshots (drift becomes observable and fail-fast).

### [licensing](https://github.com/bsayli/licensing)
For **SaaS / enterprise teams** needing a complete **license issue/validate lifecycle** with strong security primitives.  
**Proof:** Keycloak + Redis + EdDSA-signed JWT flow, plus SDK & CLI and Docker-based setup.
